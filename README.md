## 1. Project Goal
- Evaluate the RP2040 Pico-W capabilities:
  - Test processing power and memory management
  - Assess Wi-Fi connectivity features
- Compare programming paradigms:
  - Analyze C++ performance and low-level control
  - Explore Python's rapid prototyping capabilities


## 2. Programming Environment Setup
- Hardware preparation:
  - Connect Pico-W to development machine
  - Set up power supply and necessary cables

    In my particular case I used pico zero as it was the cheapest one as a Pico A
    of course you need to connect to appropiate UART1 pins on Pico A

- Software configuration:
  - Add Raspberry Pi Pico extension to VSCode and Pico SDK and toolchain are automatically confugred
  
- Debugging tools:
  - Set up OpenOCD for on-chip debugging
  - Configure GDB for breakpoint debugging

## 3. Advanced Hardware Configuration
- Debugprobe setup:
  - Flashing second Pico with debugprobe firmware
  - Connect SWD lines between debugprobe and target Pico-W

- UART bridge configuration:
  - Set up UART pins on debugprobe for serial communication
  - Use standard  VSCode's serial monitor:
    - Port: /dev/ttyACM0
    - Baud rate: 115200
- Virtualization setup:
  - Ubuntu VM on Proxmox hypervisor was prepared with USB passthrough for USB-to-UART bridge

## 4. Code Analysis (7cpp.cpp)
Main function initializes the system, connects to Wi-Fi, sets up I2C communication, initializes a BME68X sensor, and starts a TCP server.

### Inputs

- No direct inputs, but uses predefined Wi-Fi credentials (WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD) and hardware configurations (I2C_PORT, I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL, TCP_PORT).

### Outputs

1. Status messages printed to the console:
   - Wi-Fi connection status
   - IP address
   - I2C configuration details
2. A web server that serves sensor data to connected clients


### Key Points

- Extensive error checking at each initialization step ensures the system is fully operational before proceeding.
- The program only continues if Wi-Fi connection and TCP server setup are successful.
- The BME68X sensor is likely an environmental sensor for measuring temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas resistance.

## 5. Future Enhancements
- MQTT Integration:
  - Implement MQTT client library (e.g., Paho MQTT)
  - Configure connection to MQTT broker (local or cloud-based)
  - Develop data serialization for sensor readings
- Data flow:
  - Publish sensor data to specific MQTT topics
  - Subscribe to control topics for remote sensor configuration
- Security considerations:
  - Implement TLS for MQTT connections
  - Develop authentication mechanism for MQTT client
- Scalability:
  - Design for multiple sensor support
  - Implement efficient data aggregation before transmission

Note: The extensive debugging code in 7cpp.cpp was crucial in identifying and resolving I2C initialization issues with the BME680 sensor, highlighting the importance of thorough error checking in embedded systems development.
